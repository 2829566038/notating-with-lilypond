# Notating Music with LilyPond

In this repository, we'll learn a few ways to notate music using LilyPond.

LilyPond is a free and open-source music notation system. With LilyPond, you can write your score in a plain text file. LilyPond can turn this plain text file into an engraved PDF file, PostScript file, or MIDI -- Musical Instrument Digital Interface -- file.
